## NOTICE

A major current dependency on this is having the "CloudflareFS" repository built locally and mapping to those assemblies for building things like the CLI tool. Once those libraries a fully vetted and published this will become a simpler, standard 'nuget' operation to pull down the dependencies. If you're not in the mood to spelunk that deeply into local dependency building, this project is likely not for you. (yet)

## Architecture

This project consists of three main components:

### 1. Worker (Backend)
- **Technology**: F# compiled to JavaScript via Fable
- **Runtime**: Cloudflare Workers via CloudflareFS
- **Storage**: Cloudflare R2 (single shared bucket)
- **Features**:
  - Full WebDAV protocol support (PROPFIND, GET, PUT, DELETE, MKCOL, COPY, MOVE)
  - RESTful File API for web interface
  - Authentication using Cloudflare Secrets
  - CORS enabled for web access

### 2. Pages (Frontend)
- **Technology**: F# + Fable + React + Elmish
- **UI Framework**: DaisyUI (Tailwind CSS)
- **Features**:
  - Modern file manager interface
  - Drag-and-drop file upload
  - Directory navigation with breadcrumbs
  - File operations (upload, download, delete)
  - Folder creation
  - Responsive design

### 3. CLI (Deployment Tool)

- **Technology**: F# (.NET Tool)
- **Purpose**: Streamlined deployment and user management
- **Features**:
  - One-command deployment of Worker and Pages
  - User credential management via Cloudflare Secrets
  - Deployment status monitoring
  - Uses Cloudflare management APIs
  - Also wraps Fable and Wrangler for certain functions
